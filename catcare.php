                Be Gentle!
                <dl class="desc">
                    Cats are very sensitive animals, they like to have their own space and sometimes, they
                    just want to be left alone! Of course, you should always be affectionate with your cat
                    and give him/her attention, but you also need to give them their space, as cats are very
                    independent and they're very easily annoyed. This means that you should try to
                    understand your cat and know when they are to be left alone. Not only that, but you
                    should also be very gently towards them, cats are more of the calm type and can get
                    triggered with loud noises, so be aware and look out for potential triggers! Cats can
                    also get easily spooked, for example, if you're vaccuming, so you should make sure that
                    they are comfortable in their new home wihtout too many things that can scare them.

                Microchip
                <dl class="desc">
                    Whether your cat is an inside cat or an outside cat, you should get them microchipped.
                    Unfortunately, accidents can happen, and cats can be lost, and it's mostly out of our
                    control, which is why a microchip can help you avoid the worst, by being able to locate
                    them if ever an accident happens! Even if your cat is an inside cat, there is a chance
                    that he/she could leave the house if a door is left open for too long... Microchips are
                    very helpful in situations like these and will allow you to be comfortable letting your
                    cat roam in the neighbourhood
