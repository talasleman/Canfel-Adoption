            </li>
            <li>Get all the needed equipment
                <dl class="desc">
                    To welcome your new pet at home, you have to be equipped! An animal requires some
                    equipement to ensure that he/she is healthy, happy and confortable. Although equipment

                Get your dog professionally trained (optional)
                <dl class="desc">
                    Now, this is optional, but if you are a new owner who has no experience in training a
                    dog, it is strongly recommended that you schedule a professional training for your dog.
                    It is very important for you, your dog and other dogs' safety that your dog is well
                    trained. If your dog is not well trained, it is very possible that you will not be able
                    to control him/her in dangerous situations, which will could lead in harmful actions and
                    your dog could get hurt.

                Clear you calendar!
                <dl class="desc">Having a new dog is time consuming, as they need constant care and
                    attention, since
                    their training is ongoing while adapting to their new home. It is important to take into
                    consideration that you will need to spend a lot of time with your new dog. This means
                    that, if you work outside of your home, you might consider coming back to check on your
                    dog multiple times throughout the day or ask your friend to watch them. Dogs, when left
                    alone in a new environment, often get lost and have no idea how to act properly, which
                    could cause in your couch being destroyed, your new shoe half-chewed, or a stinky
                    surprise on the floor of your kitchen!</dl>
